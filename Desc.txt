In the following Jupyter notebook you will find all the code developed for the AIS event detection part. In the first part, different heat maps to show areas of events impact and scatter plots of  the physical characteristics of boats are developed. In addition, also all the strategies of feature extraction and selection are presented which take place around the KNN and Random Forest classification algorithms. Some of these techniques are the principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis among others. Finally, in the last part, the entire part of the neural network with LSTM cells for event detection given a sequence of AIS messages is developed, included the entire part of data processing architecture to mount such sequences.
